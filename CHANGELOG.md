## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Initial release.
- PHP exception capture via a Monolog DB handler on the system logger
  (severity-thresholded, re-entrancy-guarded, never throws).
- Storefront JavaScript error capture via a CSP-safe, sampled collector and a
  hardened same-origin, rate-limited beacon endpoint.
- Smart grouping: stable fingerprints with variable-token normalisation;
  occurrence counting; automatic re-open of resolved errors on recurrence.
- Throttled email alerts (digest or individual) with per-group daily dedupe,
  severity threshold, and a per-run cap. Sent by cron only.
- Admin error grid with source/severity/status filters and Resolve / Ignore /
  Delete single + mass actions; detail view with stack traces and context.
- Privacy controls: optional IP storage and IP anonymisation.
- Retention cron + `panth:errormonitor:cleanup` console command.
- Standalone install/heartbeat reporter with Panth_Core fallback.
